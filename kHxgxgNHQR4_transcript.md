(00:00) I can check my schedule and join my next
(00:02) meeting, control my music, and even
(00:04) choose where it plays, and run
(00:05) everything in my smart home, all without
(00:07) ever leaving this free Spotlight
(00:09) replacement called Raycast. But that's
(00:11) just the beginning, because there's a
(00:13) huge amount of extensions that you can
(00:14) install with just a single click. And
(00:16) what's wild is that a lot of the best
(00:18) stuff comes built in. You don't even
(00:20) need to install anything, like a
(00:21) built-in clipboard manager that saves
(00:23) everything you copy to your clipboard,
(00:25) like text, links, files, images, and
(00:28) even videos. And if you remember even a
(00:30) single word, Raycast finds it instantly,
(00:33) even text inside images. And you can
(00:35) then press enter to paste it. And for
(00:38) those things that you're always going
(00:39) back to copy and paste, you can turn
(00:41) those into snippets, which is Raycast's
(00:43) built-in text replacement tool. Just
(00:45) give it a name, type the content, and
(00:47) set a keyword to trigger it. And now, no
(00:49) matter where you are on your Mac, just
(00:51) type that keyword, and it expands
(00:53) instantly. And if you want to get fancy,
(00:55) you can even add placeholders like the
(00:57) date, time, or custom fields that ask
(00:59) you for your input before pasting the
(01:01) full message, which is really handy to
(01:03) reply to emails. And you can manage all
(01:05) of these from the snippets page inside
(01:07) Raycast. But if you want to launch this
(01:09) or really anything in Raycast faster,
(01:12) then you've got two options. You can
(01:13) either assign an alias, which is
(01:15) basically a shortcut word that tells
(01:17) Raycast what you're looking for, or and
(01:19) this is where it gets really powerful,
(01:20) you can assign a keyboard shortcut to
(01:22) it, which bypasses the command bar
(01:24) altogether. And by the way, you can do
(01:26) this for any command, which is
(01:28) especially useful for window management,
(01:30) so you can move and resize windows
(01:32) faster. There's a ton of options here,
(01:34) but my most used ones are snap left,
(01:37) snap right, maximize, and making it
(01:40) larger or smaller. And if you're
(01:42) wondering what the hell this diamond
(01:43) icon is, that's a hyper key, which is
(01:46) when you take a key like caps lock and
(01:48) turn it into a kind of universal
(01:50) shortcut key. Behind the scenes, it acts
(01:52) like pressing command, option, control,
(01:54) and shift all at once. But all you do is
(01:56) hit the caps lock key. And this combo is
(01:58) so rare that it's not going to conflict
(02:00) with any other shortcut. And normally,
(02:02) you'd need a separate app to set this
(02:04) up, but we can do this right from
(02:05) raycast under advanced hyper key. But
(02:08) one of my favorite features in Raycast
(02:10) is the calculator because this thing
(02:12) does everything. Percentages, dates,
(02:15) time zones, currency, even unit
(02:17) conversions. Super useful. Raycast also
(02:20) pulls in your calendar and lets you
(02:22) glance at it by using the my schedule
(02:24) command, which I also have mapped to a
(02:26) hotkey. And what's cool is if a meeting
(02:27) has a link, you can just hit enter and
(02:30) it joins it instantly. And if you've
(02:32) used Notion, Obsidian, or VS Code, you
(02:34) know that those apps have a command
(02:36) pallet that gives you quick access to
(02:38) pretty much everything the app can do.
(02:39) And Raycast brings that to any app using
(02:42) the search menu items command. And
(02:44) what's happening under the hood here is
(02:46) that it's pulling in all the actions
(02:47) from the menu bar into a command pallet
(02:50) that you can search. This is especially
(02:52) useful in apps like Photoshop that have
(02:54) a million settings that you can't easily
(02:56) access. And yep, this is also mapped to
(02:58) a hotkey. And this is yet another app
(03:00) that Raycast replaces. And we're still
(03:02) only on the native features. We haven't
(03:04) even touched thirdparty extensions yet.
(03:06) And you know when you're digging through
(03:07) a pile of screenshots trying to find the
(03:09) right one. With Raycast, if you remember
(03:11) even a single word inside the
(03:13) screenshot, you can search it using the
(03:15) search screenshots command and it'll
(03:17) find it. Okay, so now I'm going to rapid
(03:19) fire through a couple more native
(03:20) features before going into third party
(03:22) extensions. First is the emoji picker.
(03:24) And this not only looks great, but it
(03:26) also includes a bunch of extra symbols
(03:28) like keyboard keys, arrows, and currency
(03:31) icons. There's also a built-in color
(03:32) picker. Just trigger it, click anywhere
(03:34) on the screen, and it's going to give
(03:36) you the hex code. They also have this
(03:37) feature called quick links, which lets
(03:39) you create shortcuts to pretty much
(03:41) anything, folders, files, apps, even
(03:44) websites. I mostly use it to jump
(03:46) straight into deep folders, but there's
(03:48) a lot more that you can do with it. And
(03:50) last but not least, there's a built-in
(03:51) Pomodoro timer called Raycast Focus that
(03:54) also blocks apps or websites while you
(03:56) work. And when the time's up, you get a
(03:58) chime and a really clean little
(04:00) animation. All right, so now let's get
(04:01) into the third party extensions that I
(04:03) use. The first one is the Apple Notes
(04:05) extension, and the standout feature here
(04:07) is how fast I can pull up my notes. I
(04:09) have the letter N as an alias for it. So
(04:11) I just type N, press space, and start
(04:13) searching. I also use similar extensions
(04:16) for Obsidian, and even for Google Drive.
(04:18) I just type my alias for those and start
(04:20) searching right away. And if you use
(04:22) something like notion or bear, there are
(04:24) extensions for those as well. There's
(04:25) also an extension for almost all
(04:27) password managers. I use one password
(04:29) and I pull up my login straight from
(04:31) Raycast every day. And by the way, if
(04:33) you press command K on this or on any
(04:35) other item in Raycast, it's going to
(04:37) show you a bunch of actions that you can
(04:39) do with it. And speaking of passwords,
(04:41) if you use two factor codes, you can
(04:42) grab those straight from Raycast as well
(04:44) using the 2FA extension. And this works
(04:47) both for messages and email. And you
(04:50) don't even have to copy. Just press
(04:51) enter and it automatically pastes it. I
(04:53) also use a few extensions for calendar
(04:55) and meetings. One of them starts a
(04:57) Google Meet instantly and copies the
(04:59) link to my clipboard. If you use Zoom or
(05:01) Teams, there are extensions for those as
(05:03) well. Another lets me easily create
(05:05) calendar events using natural language.
(05:07) And another shows me the time zones of
(05:09) family and colleagues. Raycast also
(05:11) replaces a bunch of those tiny utility
(05:13) apps that I used to keep around, like
(05:15) this one that lets me switch my audio
(05:17) input and output, or this one that lets
(05:19) me manage my Bluetooth devices, and it
(05:21) even shows battery levels for Apple
(05:23) products. There's also an extension that
(05:24) lets you uninstall any app straight from
(05:27) Raycast. And the best part is that you
(05:29) can pick the uninstaller you want. I use
(05:30) App Cleaner. It's what I've used for
(05:32) years, and now I can do it straight from
(05:34) Raycast. And there's also little stuff,
(05:36) too, like this one that keeps my Mac
(05:38) awake, or this one that opens my last
(05:40) downloaded file. But Raycast doesn't
(05:42) just replace apps. It makes the ones you
(05:44) already use way better. Like this
(05:46) Spotify extension that lets you control
(05:47) your music, start songs or playlists,
(05:50) and run a ton of other commands. I also
(05:52) use CleanShot X, which if you don't
(05:54) know, it's by far the best screenshot
(05:56) tool out there. And Raycast makes it
(05:58) even better. There's a ton of commands
(05:59) you can do with it, but the two I use
(06:01) the most is open history and restore
(06:04) recently closed. Very nice. I also use
(06:06) parcel, which tracks my deliveries, and
(06:08) flighty for my flights. And I can access
(06:10) both straight from raycast. Basically,
(06:13) if there's an app you use all the time,
(06:14) there's probably a raycast extension for
(06:16) it. But one of my favorite extensions is
(06:18) the Home Assistant one, which lets you
(06:20) control every smart home device in your
(06:22) home straight from Raycast. This one is
(06:24) far too long to go into detail here, but
(06:26) I did send out a newsletter a couple
(06:28) days ago talking specifically about
(06:30) this. If you want to check that out, the
(06:31) link is down there in the description.
(06:33) And speaking of well-designed tools, you
(06:35) might want to check out today's sponsor,
(06:36) Opera, because they've just revamped
(06:38) their browser and packed it with a ton
(06:40) of useful features like a built-in music
(06:42) player that works with all the major
(06:44) streaming services and lets you control
(06:46) your music without interrupting your
(06:47) work. And you can even detach it and
(06:49) move it anywhere. It has tab islands
(06:51) which lets you group related tabs like
(06:53) shopping or travel and expand or
(06:55) collapse them to keep things tidy. They
(06:57) also added these underlines here called
(06:59) tab traces which help you find your most
(07:01) recently visited tabs amongst all the
(07:03) clutter. The darker the underscore, the
(07:04) more recently you've been on a tab. It's
(07:06) got a split screen mode too. Just drag a
(07:08) tab down to view two pages side by side.
(07:11) And there are even a bunch of themes
(07:12) like Mitsomar or my favorite Aurora that
(07:15) change the look and sound of your
(07:17) browser. It even has a built-in AI
(07:18) called Arya. Simply press command or
(07:21) control plus slash and ask questions in
(07:23) the command line. Generate images or
(07:26) even upload an image to get more info
(07:28) about it. Check out Opera for free using
(07:30) my link in the description. Okay, so
(07:32) everything we've gone over so far is
(07:33) 100% free, but there's also two paid
(07:36) plans and this is where things get a
(07:37) little weird. The first one is called
(07:39) Raycast Pro and it gives you a few extra
(07:41) features. one of which is cloud sync so
(07:44) your settings extensions snippets and
(07:47) everything else with some exceptions
(07:48) stays in sync across all your Macs. You
(07:51) can still do this manually on the free
(07:53) plan by exporting your settings from
(07:55) Raycast on one Mac and importing them
(07:57) into Raycast on another but with the pro
(08:00) plan this happens automatically. You
(08:02) also get a built-in translator which is
(08:04) nice but you can also just get the
(08:05) Google Translate extension. Clipboard
(08:07) history also goes from being capped at 3
(08:10) months to unlimited. And this one
(08:11) actually hurts a little because your
(08:13) clipboard history is stored locally. So
(08:15) there's really no reason for this to be
(08:16) a paid feature. Not to mention, it used
(08:18) to be unlimited until they introduced
(08:20) the pro plan. You also get full window
(08:22) management capabilities, unlimited
(08:24) raycast notes, and the ability to choose
(08:26) themes. But the main selling point seems
(08:28) to be AI. This includes not just
(08:30) chatting with different language models,
(08:32) but also using AI powered commands
(08:34) inside some extensions. You can see
(08:36) which ones support this by going to the
(08:38) extensions page and looking for commands
(08:40) labeled AI extensions. And to show you
(08:42) this in action, I can ask my calendar
(08:44) when is my next video going live and it
(08:46) should answer correctly. Or I can tell
(08:48) notion to add something to a database
(08:50) straight from Raycast. I'll admit this
(08:52) is actually really cool and probably
(08:54) useful for a lot of people, just not
(08:55) really for me. And if you want to take
(08:57) it even further, there's a higher tier
(08:58) called Raycast Pro plus advanced AI. And
(09:01) the only difference here is that this
(09:03) one gives you access to more powerful
(09:04) language models across the board. And I
(09:06) know at first glance this looks like a
(09:08) way better deal than paying for Chatt
(09:10) Plus or Google Gemini. You're getting
(09:12) access to pretty much every major
(09:14) language model for less than what you'd
(09:16) pay for a single one. But it's not that
(09:17) simple. With Chatt Plus, you get a lot
(09:20) of important features that you're not
(09:21) going to get with Raycast. The most
(09:23) important one for me is persistent chat
(09:25) history. This lets me stick with the
(09:27) same project over time and pick up where
(09:29) I left off. Using it on Raycast is fast
(09:32) and it's deeply integrated with the Mac,
(09:34) but unless I'm missing something, it
(09:35) seems to be built for quick one-off
(09:37) tasks. So, for me, this isn't even close
(09:39) to a replacement. But if you're okay
(09:40) with that, then Raycast Pro might be
(09:42) worth it just for this. That's a lot you
(09:44) get for $8 a month. Plus, you're
(09:46) supporting the continued development of
(09:48) what's genuinely one of the best tools
(09:50) on the Mac. But the thing is, I only
(09:52) started using Raycast earlier this year.
(09:54) Before that, I was using Alfred and I
(09:56) used it for around 10 years. And there
(09:58) were a few things that finally pushed me
(09:59) over. The first is that Raycast is under
(10:02) constant development. There's always new
(10:04) features coming out, which makes sense
(10:05) because Alfred is maintained by just a
(10:07) couple of people, while Raycast has a
(10:09) pretty big team and it's PC funded. This
(10:12) also explains why the free version of
(10:14) Raycast is so generous. You get a ton
(10:16) out of the box, way more than Alfred.
(10:18) I think you get more out of the
(10:20) free version of Raycast than you do from
(10:22) the paid version of Alfred, which by the
(10:24) way is a onetime payment of around $40.
(10:27) But at the same time, it's that VC back
(10:29) growth mindset that has a lot of people
(10:31) worried about what could happen down the
(10:33) line, and I'll come back to this in a
(10:34) minute. Raycast also looks and feels
(10:37) like an app from 2025. Everything from
(10:39) navigating the settings to managing
(10:41) extensions is super clean and modern.
(10:43) Meanwhile, Alfred hasn't changed much
(10:45) from what it looked like 10 years ago.
(10:47) And then there's the built-in store,
(10:49) which is a huge win for Raycast. With
(10:51) Alfred, you have to either dig through
(10:52) their gallery or download random
(10:54) workflows from GitHub. Not to mention,
(10:56) the extension community is way more
(10:58) active on Raycast with new extensions
(11:01) popping up all the time. Okay, so now
(11:03) here's where Alfred still wins. Starting
(11:05) with speed, Alfred is just faster.
(11:07) There's no debate about this. Most
(11:09) actions take one less step, if not more,
(11:11) compared to Raycast. If you want to
(11:13) search for a file in Raycast, you launch
(11:15) it, type search files, hit enter, and
(11:18) then you can start searching. That's
(11:19) three steps. And even if you assign an
(11:21) alias like SF to get there faster, it's
(11:24) still three steps. With Alfred, you
(11:26) launch it, press space, and that's it.
(11:28) Same with extensions. In Alfred, you
(11:30) type 2FA, and your code is right there.
(11:32) In Raycast, you always have to select
(11:34) the extension first before anything else
(11:36) happens. Everything is always behind the
(11:38) menu. So unless you're willing to create
(11:40) a shortcut for everything you want to do
(11:41) with Raycast, Alfred will always be a
(11:44) couple seconds faster. And if you use
(11:45) this a 100 times a day, those extra
(11:47) steps start to matter. The next big one
(11:49) is cloud syncing. With Alfred, this is
(11:52) completely free. You just drop your
(11:53) settings folder into iCloud or Dropbox
(11:56) and it's going to sync across all your
(11:58) Macs. Raycast makes you pay for that. If
(12:00) you want to sync your settings the easy
(12:02) way without manually exporting and
(12:04) importing between Macs, you'll need the
(12:06) Pro plan. And this leads me to my next
(12:08) point, which is privacy. Because when
(12:10) you use their pro plan, it syncs your
(12:12) data through their servers. That
(12:14) includes your settings, snippets, notes,
(12:16) and a bunch of other things. It's not
(12:18) shady, and they're transparent about it,
(12:20) but it does mean that more of your data
(12:22) flows through them. Alfred, on the other
(12:24) hand, is offline first. It stores
(12:26) everything locally and only pings their
(12:28) servers to activate the license key. And
(12:30) lastly, Alfred has been around for 15
(12:32) years. They're not going anywhere.
(12:34) They've had the same sustainable
(12:35) business model for years and it works.
(12:37) As much as I like Raycast, we don't know
(12:39) what the future holds and we could very
(12:41) well see some form of inchification.
(12:43) They already placed the cap on clipboard
(12:45) history from unlimited to 3 months. And
(12:47) this is really just a cash grab as your
(12:49) clipboard is stored locally and doesn't
(12:51) sync with their servers. What if next
(12:53) it'll be a cap on how many snippets you
(12:54) can have or how many extensions you can
(12:56) install? These are things that just
(12:58) won't happen with Alfred. But even after
(13:00) all of that, I still think that Raycast
(13:02) is the better option. I don't love that
(13:03) it's VC funded, but that's just the
(13:05) nature of things. The truth is that
(13:07) right now, this is the better product.
(13:08) Its free version is insanely good. It
(13:11) comes with amazing built-in features,
(13:12) and the third party extensions work
(13:14) really well and are very stable. It also
(13:16) keeps getting better every week, and
(13:18) they actually listen to the community,
(13:20) which really matters. It's not perfect,
(13:21) and yeah, when I first switch, taking
(13:23) that extra step for everything was
(13:25) annoying, but I got used to it, and in
(13:27) return, I get a lot more out of it than
(13:29) I did with Alfred. Raycast replaces a
(13:31) ton of apps, but definitely not all of
(13:33) them. And if you want to check out the
(13:34) other Mac apps that I still rely on,
(13:36) then watch this video here, and I'll see
(13:38) you there.
